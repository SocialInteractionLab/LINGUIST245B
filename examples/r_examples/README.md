## Guidelines for creating your project directory

1. Name your project directory intuitively. For example, if I want to replicate Bott & Noveck 2004 on scalar implicatures, I may call my directory *scalar_implicature_bn*. 

2. Include a README.md file at the top level of your project directory. The README should contain a short paragraph about your project.

3. Your project directory should contain the following sub-directories:

	- experiment
	- data
	- analysis
	- docs

4. Each of the sub-directories should contain a README.md file with a (few) sentence(s) on what it contains.
