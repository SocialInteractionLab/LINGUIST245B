## Course description

Over the past decades, linguists have become increasingly interested in testing theories with a wider range of empirical data than the traditionally accepted introspective judgments of hand-selected linguistic examples. Consequently, linguistics has seen a surge of interest in psycholinguistic methods across all subfields. This course will provide an overview of various standard psycholinguistic techniques and measures. Methodologically, a particular focus will be placed on a problem that runs through all measures and techniques: that of generating an appropriate linking hypothesis from theoretical predictions to an expected empirical response pattern. 

The class is based around discussion of research articles and conducting either an original experiment or a replication of a published experiment. Students will gain hands-on experience using html/javascript/css for experimental design and implementation; using Prolific Academic for running experiments online; using R for data management, analysis, and visualization; using git/GitHub for version control; and using the Open Science Framework for preregistering experiments.

## Learning goals

- Learn to design, run, and analyze an experiment.

- Learn to read and assess experimental research papers.

## Assessment

- 50% final project (experiment replication or original experiment)

- 25% presentations (paper and project)

- 25% in-class participation and posting response posts on readings

## Prerequisites

1. Familiarity with (at least some subfields of) linguistics.
2. Basic familiarity with R. If you have never used R, install [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) and complete the "Introduction to R" on [datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/home). We'll use it for data analysis and visualization.
3. Basic familiarity with navigating the command line. Complete at least the first two tutorials of [this UNIX tutorial](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/) if you have never used the command line.
4. Basic familiarity with javascript/HTML/CSS. If you have never used these, complete [this javascript tutorial](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript) and [this HTML tutorial](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html). You may also find [this CSS tutorial](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css) useful.
5. We'll use [git](https://git-scm.com/) & [GitHub](https://github.com/) to store collected data, analysis scripts, and basic documentation. Make sure they're installed on your system.   
6. We'll use the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/) to pre-register your experiments. Sign up for an account if you don't already have one.

If you feel overwhelmed by any of these except 1., don't worry. It will take work, but by the end of the quarter you'll have acquired all of these tools to at least a basic working level. [This website](https://sebschu.com/web-based-experiments/) contains lots of useful information about tool setup.

## Readings

We'll be making use of original papers, blog posts / online articles, as well as the following textbooks:
1. The bible of mixed effects models: Gelman, A., & Hill, J. (2007). [Data analysis using regression and multilevel/hierarchical models](https://canvas.stanford.edu/files/12702650/download). Cambridge University Press.
2. Rosenthal, R., & Rosnow, R. L. (2008). Essentials of behavioral research: Methods and data analysis (3rd ed.). McGraw-Hill.
3. Frank, M.C., Braginsky, M., Cachia, J.,  Coles, N., Hardwicke, T., Hawkins, R., Mathur, M., and Williams, R. [Experimentology: An Open Science Approach to Experimental Psychology Methods](https://experimentology.io/).


[This list of questions](https://canvas.stanford.edu/files/12702649/download?download_frd=1) will help guide reading experimental papers.

## Class projects

Each student will complete a class project, which will be either a replication of a previously published experiment (preferred at the undergraduate level), or an original design (dispreferred, unless clearly building on previous work or unless you've already developed the design; good option for graduate students). Assessment will be based on  lighting project proposal presentations (5 minutes), final project presentations (last week of class) and a 5-10 page writeup (due Jun 13). 

[This repository](https://github.com/thegricean/LINGUIST245B) contains useful information for setting up experiments and analyzing data (experimental templates, code sheets, etc). 

## Schedule

The course will meet Mondays and Wednesdays from 10:30-11:50am in Room 460-048.
