## Course description

Over the past decades, linguists have become increasingly interested in testing theories with a wider range of empirical data than introspective judgments of hand-selected linguistic examples. Consequently, linguistics has seen a surge of interest in psycholinguistic methods across all subfields. This course will provide an overview of standard psycholinguistic techniques and measures. 

At a theoretical level, a particular focus will be placed on a problem that runs through all measures and techniques: that of generating an appropriate linking hypothesis from theoretical predictions to expected empirical response patterns.

At a practical level, the class is based around conducting a hands-on replication of a published experiment. Students will gain experience with current best practices for the experimental workflow: using html/javascript/css to design and implement experimental paradigms; using Prolific to run experiments online; using R to wrangle, analyze, and visualize data; using git/GitHub to projects under version control; and using the Open Science Framework to pre-register experiments.

## Learning goals

- Learn to design, run, and analyze an experiment.

- Learn to read and assess experimental research papers.

## Assessment

- 50% weekly project milestones

- 25% presentations (proposal and project)

- 25% in-class participation and posting response posts on readings

## Prerequisites

1. Familiarity with (at least some subfields of) linguistics.
2. Basic familiarity with R. If you have never used R, install [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) and complete the "Introduction to R" on [datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/home). We'll use it for data analysis and visualization.
3. Basic familiarity with navigating the command line. Complete at least the first two tutorials of [this UNIX tutorial](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/) if you have never used the command line.
4. Basic familiarity with javascript/HTML/CSS. If you have never used these, complete [this javascript tutorial](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript) and [this HTML tutorial](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html). You may also find [this CSS tutorial](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css) useful.
5. We'll use [git](https://git-scm.com/) & [GitHub](https://github.com/) to store collected data, analysis scripts, and basic documentation. Make sure they're installed on your system.   
6. We'll use the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/) to pre-register your experiments. Sign up for an account if you don't already have one.

If you feel overwhelmed by any of these except (1), don't worry. It will take work, but by the end of the quarter you'll have acquired all of these tools to at least a basic working level. [This website](https://sebschu.com/web-based-experiments/) contains lots of useful information about tool setup.

## Readings

We'll be making use of original papers, blog posts / online articles, as well as the following textbooks:

1. Gelman, A., & Hill, J. (2007). [Data analysis using regression and multilevel/hierarchical models](https://canvas.stanford.edu/files/12702650/download). Cambridge University Press.
3. Frank, M.C., Braginsky, M., Cachia, J.,  Coles, N., Hardwicke, T., Hawkins, R., Mathur, M., and Williams, R. (2025). [Experimentology: An Open Science Approach to Experimental Psychology Methods](https://experimentology.io/). MIT Press. 

## Course format

*Readings & discussion*: Brief 1-2 paragraph responses for Monday readings will be collected in advance to facilitate class discussion (due midnight the night before). 

*Project*: Each student will complete replication of a previously published experiment. Assessment will be based on lighting project proposal presentations (5 minutes), final project presentations (last week of class) and a 5-10 page replication report (due June 6th). Undergraduates are welcome to work in groups, with instructor permission. 

## Schedule

The course will meet Mondays and Wednesdays from 3:00-4:20pm in McMurtry Art Building 360.
