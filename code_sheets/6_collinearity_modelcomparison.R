# An extreme example of collinearity:

# No significant effect of meanSize on RTs
m = lmer(RT ~ meanSize + (1|Word) + (1|Subject), data=lexdec, REML=F)
summary(m)

# No significant effect of meanWeight on RTs either
m = lmer(RT ~ meanWeight + (1|Word) + (1|Subject), data=lexdec, REML=F)
summary(m)

# If both are included in the model, there are large and highly significant counter-directed effects of the two predictors:
m = lmer(RT ~ meanWeight + meanSize + (1|Word) + (1|Subject), data=lexdec, REML=F)
summary(m)

# If we also include frequency, the effect disappears again
m = lmer(RT ~ meanWeight + meanSize + Frequency + (1|Word) + (1|Subject), data=lexdec, REML=F)
summary(m)

# Test for collinearity: 
# 1. Inspect correlation matrix -- if below .4, all is good
# 2. Compute variance inflation factor (VIF) -- if < 4, all is good
vif.mer(m) # ...we have a problem

# Let's investigate.

(cor(lexdec$RT,lexdec$Fitted))^2 # simple, but not quite correct way of computing R^2 value for mixed effects model (does not take into account structure introduced by random effects -- see also this blog post https://jonlefcheck.net/2013/03/13/r2-for-linear-mixed-effects-models/)

# To compute marginal R^2 (variance explained by fixed effects) and conditional R^2 (variance explained by fixed and random effects):
install.packages("piecewiseSEM")
library(piecewiseSEM)

sem.model.fits(m.full) # Conditional R^2 is somewhat lower than R^2 computed without taking into account random effects
